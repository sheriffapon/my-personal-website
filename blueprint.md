# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website for Sheriffapon, a full-stack developer. The website will be a modern, responsive, and visually appealing single-page application built with Next.js.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Setup:** The project was initialized as a standard Next.js application.
*   **AI Chatbot:** A draggable AI chatbot is integrated into the website to provide a conversational experience.

## Current Plan: Add a Draggable AI Chatbot

This plan outlines the steps to add a draggable AI chatbot to the portfolio website.

### Structure & Content

1.  **Chatbot Component:**
    *   A draggable icon that opens a chat window.
    *   Simulated conversation logic.
    *   A simple UI for the chat window.

### Design & UX

*   **Draggable Icon:** The chatbot icon can be moved anywhere on the screen.
*   **Chat Window:** The chat window has a clean and simple design.

### Development Plan

1.  **Chatbot Component:** Create a `Chatbot` component with the following features:
    *   A draggable icon implemented with React's built-in event handlers (`onMouseDown`, `onMouseMove`, `onMouseUp`).
    *   A chat window that opens when the icon is clicked.
    *   A simulated conversation logic to respond to user messages.
2.  **Integration:** Integrate the `Chatbot` component into the main page.
3.  **Documentation:** Update the `blueprint.md` to reflect the new chatbot feature.
